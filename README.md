    2. Generate random index from 0 to current position
    3. Swap current element with randomly selected element
    4. Move to previous element and repeat
    """
    n = len(questions_list)
    for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1):

```

### **📊 Question Quality Assurance**

**Before Fix:**
```
❌ Question: "What is the negative form of 'I am happy'?"
   Options: ["I am not happy", "I'm not happy", ...]
   Problem: Both options are essentially the same!
```

**After Fix:**
```
✅ Question: "What is the negative form of 'I am happy'?"
   Options: ["I am not happy", "I not happy", "I don't happy", "I am no happy"]
   Solution: Each option tests different grammar concepts!
```
