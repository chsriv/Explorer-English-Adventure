# This is a temporary file to backup the fix for the session state issue
# The main issue was: st.session_state.realm_progress[realm_key][difficulty]
# Should be: len(st.session_state.chapter_stats[realm_key][difficulty]['questions_taken'])

# And: st.session_state.realm_progress[realm_key][difficulty] += 1
# Should be: (remove this line as progress is tracked automatically)

# The current_question_idx should be used for progress tracking
