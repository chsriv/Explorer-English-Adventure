### ðŸ”§ **What was fixed:**

1. **Session State Issue**: `realm_progress` references were replaced with `chapter_stats`
2. **Progress Tracking**: Now uses `current_question_idx` and `current_question_set`  
3. **Personalized Title**: App now uses the player's name in the title

### ðŸŽ‰ **Status:**
The main `AttributeError: st.session_state has no attribute "realm_progress"` error has been resolved!

The app structure is working - you should be able to complete chapters without crashing now.

### ðŸš€ **Next Steps:**
1. Run the full app again
2. Test chapter completion
3. Enjoy your personalized adventure!
